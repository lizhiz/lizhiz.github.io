## Miscellaneous

I speak Mandarian, Cantonese, Engilish. I was born in [Hengyang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hengyang), China. And my family moved to [Guangzhou](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guangzhou) when I was four. I have lived in Guangzhou for 18 years. It's a beautiful city and if you love food, particularly dim sum, you really should visit.

I like travelling, especially road trips. I enjoy learning languages and their dialects. It's fun to meet and talk to people from different places, and to know their cultures!

In my spire time, I like to read books in psychoanalysis and do sketch practice. That's how I relax myself and clear my mind.

My favoriate TV series are [Game of Thrones](https://www.hbo.com/game-of-thrones) and [Criminal Minds](http://www.cbs.com/shows/criminal_minds/).

Oh, I am a foodie and I love to cook for friends! Here is part of my chef's recommendation: Braised Pork Belly, Tangsu Ribs, Roast Crab with Special Source, Chicken with Szechuan Garlic Sauce.
