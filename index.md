I am a software engineer of the R&D team in the Network Cloud Engine(NCE) department at [HUAWEI TECHNOLOGIES CO., LTD.](http://www.huawei.com/en/) The project we are working on is [Premium Broadband](https://carrier.huawei.com/en/spotlight/premium-home-broadband-enables-business-success). You can know more about our project from [UBBF 2018](https://www.huawei.com/uk/press-events/events/ubbf-2018?ic_medium=hwdc&ic_source=corp_event3_ubbf2018).

I received an Excellent(Top 10% in HUAWEI) in my probation appraisal. Also, I am leading a new project in building automatic verification system with thoughts and technologies in big data. I am also seeking opportunities to pursue a Ph.D. degree, specialized in machine learning.

I obtained my MSc. in [Electrical Engineering](http://www.ee.ucla.edu) from the University of California, Los Angeles ([UCLA](http://www.ucla.edu)) in March 2017. During July 2016 to March 2017, I worked as a research associate in MR(Magnetic Resonance) Engineering Laboratory ([Han Laboratory](https://www.cedars-sinai.edu/Research/Research-Labs/Han-Lab/)), affiliated with Biomedical Imaging Research Institute ([BIRI](https://www.cedars-sinai.edu/Research/Departments-and-Institutes/Biomedical-Imaging-Research-Institute/)) at [Cedars-Sinai Medical Center](https://www.cedars-sinai.org), Los Angeles.
