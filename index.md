## [](#header-2)Welcome to my homepage.

* * *

Currently, I am preparing applications of Ph.D. programs in Computer Science, specialized in machine learning. I obtained my MSc. in [Electrical Engineering](http://www.ee.ucla.edu) from University of California, Los Angeles ([UCLA](http://www.ucla.edu)) in March 2017. During July 2016 to March 2017, I worked as a research associate in MR(Magnetic Resonance) Engineering Laboratory ([Han Laboratory](https://www.cedars-sinai.edu/Research/Research-Labs/Han-Lab/)), affiliated with Biomedical Imaging Research Institute ([BIRI](https://www.cedars-sinai.edu/Research/Departments-and-Institutes/Biomedical-Imaging-Research-Institute/)) at [Cedars-Sinai Medical Center](https://www.cedars-sinai.org), Los Angeles. Before coming to the states, I earned my Bachelor's degree in Automation from Guangdong University of Technology, China. 

You can find the details of my background and selected projects in my [CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zGm9_Gq8WLz268AuA_ncwtrN-kNaPa62/view?usp=sharing).
